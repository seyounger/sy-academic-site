abstract: "Dense understory thickets of the native evergreen shrub Rhododendron maximum expanded
initially following elimination of American chestnut by the chestnut blight, and later in response
to loss of the eastern hemlock due to hemlock woolly adelgid invasion. Rhododendron thickets
often blanket streams and their riparian zones, creating cool, low-light microclimates. To
determine the effect of such understory thickets on summer stream temperatures, we removed
riparian rhododendron understory on 300m reaches of two southern Appalachian Mountain
headwater streams, while leaving two 300m reference reaches undisturbed. Overhead canopy
was left intact in all four streams, but all streams were selected to have a significant component
of dead or dying eastern hemlock in the overstory, creating time-varying canopy gaps throughout
the reach. We continuously monitored temperatures upstream, within, and downstream of
treatment and reference reaches. Temperatures were monitored in all four streams in the summer
before treatments were imposed (2014), and for two summers following treatment (2015, 2016).
Temperatures varied significantly across and within streams prior to treatment and across years
for the reference streams. After rhododendron removal, increases in summer stream temperatures
were observed at some locations within the treatment reaches, but these increases did not persist
downstream and varied by watershed, sensor, and year. Significant increases in daily maxima in
treatment reaches ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 C. The data indicate that overhead canopy provided
enough shade to prevent rhododendron removal from increasing summer temperatures to levels
deleterious to native cold-water fauna and that local temperature effects were not persistent."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We investigated how understory riparian rhododendron thickets moderate summer stream temperatures using a paired watershed approach. Removal of this low light microclimate produced significant, but highly variable increases in summer stream temperatures."
