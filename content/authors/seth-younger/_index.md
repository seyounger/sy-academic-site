My research focuses on the effects of land use and forest management practices on evapotranspiration partitioning and water yield. My previous research has quantified the hydrologic effects of different land uses and forest management practices in the southeast U.S and quantified precipitation partitioning for bioenergy plantations. I will be joining the Jones Center at Ichuaway in late January 2021 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate where I will work on modeling the water yield effects of Longleaf pine restoration and forest management practices on the southeast Coastal Plain.
